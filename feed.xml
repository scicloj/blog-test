While the infrastructure and tooling are gradually maturing, new libraries and experiments are rising. It seems that we are on a phase transition, and some beautiful things are about to happen.It is a good time to meet and catch up, hear about active projects and discuss future directions and ways to collaborate.</description><author>Daniel Slutsky</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-18-covid-19-hackathons-announcement/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-18-covid-19-hackathons-announcement/</link><title>COVID-19 online hackathons I &amp; II</title><description>Following yesterday's post suggesting a COVID-19 online hackathon, we got some of reactions at the mail group, the subreddit, the date poll, and mainly the relevant Zulip chat streams.Two hackathons</description><author>Teodor Heggelund and Daniel Slutsky</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-17-covid-19-hackathon-planning/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-17-covid-19-hackathon-planning/</link><title>Planning a COVID-19 online hackathon</title><description>The scicloj community is organizing an online hackathon for studying COVID-19 data.Please mark your preferred dates for the hackathon here (yes/no/if-need-be).</description><author>Teodor Heggelund and Daniel Slutsky</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-07-guix-jupyter/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-07-guix-jupyter/</link><title>Meeting Video: Guix-Jupyter with Ludovic Courtès</title><description>A lot has been happening at Scicloj in the last few weeks, but now we finally managed to edit and publish the video from a meeting we've had at January 9th.It was a special meeting, as we the topic was something out of the ususal Clojure scope: Guix-Jupyter reproducible notebooks.</description><author>Daniel Slutsky</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-05-rgsoc2020/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-03-05-rgsoc2020/</link><title>Data Science in Clojure at Rails Girls Summer of Code</title><description>In this post I wish to write briefly about the "data science in clojure" project in Rails Girls Summer of Code 2020.Hoping to encourage people to join as students or coaches, I will try to argue why (in my opinion) it is important to the healthy growth of the clojure data science ecosystem: not only by actively addressing our goal to create a welcoming community, but also by creating a continuous process of experimentation and reflection about the usability of the emerging stack.</description><author>Daniel Slutsky</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2019-10-18-data-wishes/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2019-10-18-data-wishes/</link><title>Clojure and data: wishes, problems, and ideas</title><description>On Sunday afternoon, Sep. 29th 2019, we had a meeting at the 8-bit-sheep office of Sami at Maria 01, Helsinki. One hour earlier, Konrad just finished participating in a 24h opendata hackathon. We were all tired and emotionally affected by ClojuTRE, that just ended on Friday.We ended up having a long conversation about our goals and wishes, as individuals and as parts of a community. A lot of personal stories and wild ideas were running in the room. Later Sami took us on a ride around Helsinki, which opened our tired minds even wider.</description><author>Sami Kallinen, Konrad Kühne, Daniel Slutsky</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2019-05-23-clojure-scientists/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2019-05-23-clojure-scientists/</link><title>Are we scientists yet?</title><description>Previous version of this postThe Clojure community is moving a lot lately on the data science front, but we were feeling we needed some organization and more open discussion about these themes.

This is the Clojureverse thread that started it all. Here we try to collect and record the current state of things, and I would like to stress the fact that this is owned by the community!I really like how the Nim community is dealing with the same sorts of problems we're facing, so I'll try the same thing here to foster discussion. We might want to move these things in their own topic in the future or on other platforms, but that's not the point right now.</description><author>Alan Marazzi</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-12-03-docs/</guid><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog-test/posts/2020-12-03-docs/</link><title>Cryogen Quick Start Guide</title><description>This intro only documents a subset of Cryogen's features.
